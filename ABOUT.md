# About this project

Most PyTorch learning resources are either out-of-date, confusing (why so many [official tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)?) or unnecessarily complicated.

In my opinion, a true gem for learning PyTorch from scratch was the [PyTorch Tutorial](https://github.com/yunjey/pytorch-tutorial) by [Yunjey Choi](https://yunjey.github.io/). Unfortunately, it has been unmaintained for years.

This project aims to follow a similar path by providing a set of bare-bones, self-sufficient, and beginner-friendly examples. They illustrate the core parts of PyTorch in a step-by-step fashion, from tensor manipulation to the training of Deep Learning models. They strive to keep up with API changes and follow good practices.

Rather than Jupyter notebooks, these examples are provided as pure Python files because I think it facilitates a global understanding of their structure. It also simplifies [code formatting](https://github.com/psf/black), [linting](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint), [testing](https://docs.pytest.org). All code examples are heavily commented and accompanied by README files for additional information.

You are very welcome to contribute to the improvement of this project through [ideas](https://github.com/bpesquet/pytorch-tutorial/issues) or [corrections](https://github.com/bpesquet/pytorch-tutorial/pulls).

Happy PyTorch learning :)
